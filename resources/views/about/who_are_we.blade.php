                         <p>Our 122-point due diligence checklist is a leader in the market and is expected to be the industry standard in the coming years. And for good reason.</p>
                         <p>The report is critical before any property purchase, breaking down every detail of a developer, development, investment area and financials with a simple star scoring system.</p>
                         <p>We understand the developers financial situation, track record, and ensure every document from planning applications, highways acts, title deeds, lease details are all in place so you don’t have to.</p>
                         <p>This means that every investment you look at with a Baron & Cabot 122-point report in place will have been fully independently researched.</p>
                         <p>With our 122-point report, you can focus on the best investment for you, knowing the research has already been done.</p>
                         <p>Don’t buy any UK property until you have seen the Baron & Cabot 122-point report on it.
